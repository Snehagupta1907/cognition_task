# CypherX Task

## Overview

This repository contains the solution for the CypherX Task Assignment, an interactive React application that allows users to manage and visualize tickets from a provided API. The application supports dynamic grouping and sorting based on different criteria, providing a flexible and user-friendly experience.

## Features

- **Dynamic Grouping:** Users can group tickets based on three criteria - Status, User, and Priority.
- **Sorting Options:** Tickets can be sorted by Priority (descending) or Title (ascending).
- **Responsive Design:** The Kanban board is designed to be responsive and visually appealing, ensuring a seamless experience across devices.
- **Persistence:** User's view state is saved, allowing the application to retain the selected grouping and sorting even after a page reload.
